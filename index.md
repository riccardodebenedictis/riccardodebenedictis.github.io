Hi all! I am **{{site.name}}**. I have a M.Sc. in Computer Engineering since 2010 from University of Rome 'La Sapienza' and a Ph.D. in Computing, Electronics and Mathematics since 2019 from University of Plymouth.

I am a researcher in Artificial Intelligence at the Institute of Cognitive Sciences and Technologies of CNR. My [research](/research/) topics concern the development of automated reasoning solvers aimed at addressing real world applications, while keeping a strong consideration for the human component that must interact with the intelligent applications. Special attention is given to the efficiency of the reasoning processes, obtained through the development of domain-independent heuristics which, in an integrated way, allow solving semantic inference problems, planning and scheduling problems, as well as their execution and adaptation in dynamic environments.

From September to December 2015 I have been part of the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning group of the Pompeu Fabra University of Barcelona under the supervision of Hector Geffner.

I have worked since 2010 on several projects under the FP7, H2020 and AAL research and innovation framework programs.

I am currently studying the integration of different AI techniques for executing plans in nondeterministic environments.
