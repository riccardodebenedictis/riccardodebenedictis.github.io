[M.Sc. in Computer Engineering in 2010 at University of Rome 'La Sapienza'; Ph.D. in Computing, Electronics and Mathematics in 2019 at University of Plymouth].

I am a researcher in Artificial Intelligence at the Institute of Cognitive Sciences and Technologies of CNR. My research topics concern the development of automated reasoning solvers aimed at addressing real world applications, while keeping a strong consideration for the human component that must interact with the intelligent applications. Special attention is given to the efficiency of the reasoning processes, obtained through the development of domain-independent heuristics which, in an integrated way, allow solving semantic inference problems, planning and scheduling problems, as well as their execution and adaptation in dynamic environments.

I have worked since 2010 on several projects under the FP7, H2020 and AAL research and innovation framework programs.

I am currently studying the integration of different AI techniques for executing plans in nondeterministic environments.
