title: Enhanced Telepresence
---

Mobile Telepresence Robots is a class of robots having no or very limited autonomy which might allow mitigating the problem of isolation of older adults living alone. A strong point of these robot platforms, however, lies in their cost-effectiveness, which makes them very attractive for the national health systems and for ordinary users. It is therefore interesting to enhance their abilities through the introduction of proactive services and capabilities.
